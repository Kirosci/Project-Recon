Top Priority

- Check -nmap and -js flag, fix if something's wrong
- Format results of urls and seperate urls by extensions like reconftw






-------
- To check if any tool gets stuck:
    make a log file, update it by writing ouput of every running tools to it, if nothing has been written to it for a long time and the process took long enough than expected, then kill the process and create the base ouput file for it or restart it

- Add logic to check if there is no line in any file, like subdomain.txt or assetfinder.txt in tmp folder or any file containing result, then run the tool, as when it checks if the file exists then it doesn't runs and even overwrites the file with no value

- Fix, why gau and wayback aren't working


- Add these in setup.sh:

go install github.com/tomnomnom/fff@latest

- Implement JS methodology in Project-Recon


NEED to continue from saving js files, check fff and meg
--------

Currently on:
- organise.sh
    - currently it moves all results of provided domains to a centralised provided folder, and combines results of files that are not in a separate dir, like urls.txt subdomains.txt
    
    - TODO
        - Combine results of dir such as fuzz, nmap, screenshots, etc
        - Currently working on this in org.sh file in "/home/cyrusop/bugBounty/serber/bugbounty/Project-Recon/VEEPEE/org.sh"
